All businesses use data to determine marketing decisions. Financial institutions are no different and gather information on their clients and potential clients in order to sell them different products like term deposits. Term deposits are a fixed-term investment that includes depositing money into an account at a financial institution. These fixed terms often range in maturity length from one month to multiple years. This offers the client a lower risk investment to save money while gaining a small amount of interest while the financial institution loans that investment to other clients seeking to take out loans. Longer fixed-term investments will generate more interest for both the bank and the client so it is in the interest of the bank to solicit more clients to subscribe to these investments and clients to deposit large amounts into these investments. This project aims to determine the likelihood of a client to subscribe to a term deposit based on the client's personal, demographic, and banking information.
